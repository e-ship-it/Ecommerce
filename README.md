# Real-Time E-commerce Product Recommendation System

## About This Project

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey as I build a real-time e-commerce product recommendation system. I’m exploring key concepts including:

- Streaming data ingestion with Kafka (simulated via Python)
- Data storage and transformation with PostgreSQL and dbt
- Collaborative filtering models in Python for recommendations
- Dashboarding with Tableau Public
- Automation and CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub Actions

I’m developing this project step-by-step, documenting progress, challenges, and solutions along the way.

## Current Status

- Data ingestion pipelines set up for streaming and batch data using Kafka and Python.
- Raw and staging data models implemented in dbt following Data Vault methodology in progress.
- Analytics and ML model development will start next.
- Dashboarding and CI/CD automation planned.

## Roadmap / Next Steps

- Finalize analytics layer and implement collaborative filtering models.
- Integrate real-time model updates with streaming data.
- Develop interactive dashboards in Tableau Public.
- Set up Jenkins pipeline for automated training and deployment.
- Optimize data pipeline for scale and efficiency.

## Learning Notes

- Emphasizing clean code, modular design, and version control best practices.
- Refactoring pipelines as I learn new patterns and tools.
- Experimenting with different ML algorithms to improve recommendation accuracy.
